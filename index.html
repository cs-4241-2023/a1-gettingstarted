    <h3><span>Working Experience</span></h3>

    <p>
      As for working experience, I have had two great summer experiences as a
      software engineering intern. This past summer, I worked at Northrop
      Grumman and supported the DARPA SafeDocuments program where I contributed
      to a framework API. The summer prior, I worked at Scheduling Systems Inc.
      where I added features to their application sold to clients such as
      American Airlines and Delta.
