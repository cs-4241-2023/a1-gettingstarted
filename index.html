    <p>Class: It's complicated (2025? I hope!)</p>
    <p>
      Mechanical engineering for the first 10 years. Now computer science.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Previous Courses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CS1100</li>
      <li>CS2100</li>
      <li>Systems Programming</li>
      <li>Software Engineering (students in that course are no longer allowed to own their own repositories because of me. Long story).</li>
      <li>Foundations of Computer Science</li>
      <li>Computational Theory</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Languages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual Basic (first programming course in high school back in the early 2000s)</li>
      <li>C++ (self-taught, also in high-school. Big mistake)</li>
      <li>C# (self-taught, not a mistake at all)</li>
      <li>Typescript (dev bootcamp that was a complete rip-off. This was before I <em>returned</em> to WPI)</li>
      <li>Java (why does WPI's CS department use this instead of C#?)</li>
      <li>Racket (WTF? Why doesn't WPI use a real functional language like F# or Haskel?)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Work </h3>
