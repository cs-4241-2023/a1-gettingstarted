    <p><button onclick="resetAndAnimateBox()">Move Square</button></p>
    <div id="box"></div>
    <script>
      const box = document.getElementById("box");
      let position = 0;
      const speed = 2;

      function animateBox() {
        position += speed;
        box.style.left = position + "px";

        if (position < window.innerWidth - box.clientWidth) {
          requestAnimationFrame(animateBox);
        }
      }
      function resetAndAnimateBox() {
        position = 0;
        box.style.left = "0";
        animateBox();
      }
