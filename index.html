          Hi everyone! I am currently a senior student at Worcester Polytechnic
          Institute (WPI). Over the summer I worked with Acadia National Park to
          redesign the Acadia Trails website which holds a collection of 360&deg
          panoramic images along all of Acadia's beautiful hiking trails. Learn
          more about my work and project experience, campus involvements, and
          more below!

            >
          </h4>
          <p>
            In the modern era, websites are the preeminent method for connecting
            people to new experiences and perspectives. For Acadia National
            Park, inequalities in accessibility, safety concerns, and
            environmental changes motivated the development of an interactive
            online tool to share its stunning hiking trails with the world. In
            this project, the
            <b>Acadia Trails</b> website was transformed into a state-of-the-art
            hub for immersive panoramic tours of the 125+ miles of trails in the
            park. To accomplish this, the website was reconstructed with a
            user-focused design perspective, and many panoramic tours were
            recaptured or reprocessed to improve their quality. Using several
            evaluative methods, the updated website was found to be navigable,
            informative, and compelling for a wide audience.

            Everyone that shops for groceries and cooks their own meals knows
            how difficult it can be to buy the right amount of food for the week
            without ending up with things being wasted. Expiration dates seem to
            slip through our fingers when we least expect them to, and spoiled
            milk ends up in our morning cup of coffee. There seems to be no way
            to keep track of what is going bad when and making sure that we use
            those ingredients before it’s too late – until now!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to <b>Grocery Aid</b>, you no longer have to spend hours
            checking the fridge looking at those tiny expiration dates or
            worrying about accidentally wasting food. Grocery Aid is your
            personal grocery assistant, keeping track of all those aggravations
            for you.

            This research study was conducted to investigate how the magnitude
            and frequency of frame time display affect user gaming experience
            and performance. This was done using a racing car game known as
            SuperTuxKart. All findings were shared with project sponsors from
            Intel and further studies are being done to expand upon said
            findings.

            With busy schedules due to classwork, sports, and other activities,
            college students tend to neglect their house plants. But what if
            there was a system that helped keep you and your plants happy?
          </p>
          <p><b>Bob</b> is here to help!</p>
          <p>
            <b>Bob</b> is two parts: a soil moisture monitor and an SMS
            notification system. When Bob measures your plant's soil and it's
            dry, he will text you a notification that it needs to be watered.
            Bob will also inform you of the last time you watered your plant.

            Currently, over 1.7 billion websites exist, but what makes a good
            website? How can we engage a user with combinations of computer
            science and art? These were the main questions examined in my
            website redesign of a local small business in Worcester, MA. Over a
            period of seven weeks, I developed and followed my own design
            process which included research, ideation, design, and prototyping
            for both a web and a mobile design. I have now created two fully
            functional prototypes with user flow videos to accompany them.
