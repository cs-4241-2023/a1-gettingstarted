## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added CSS rules for the html, body selector to get rid of the default margin and padding. In the body selector, there is a linear-gradient that changes from one color to the next at a slightly diagonal turn angle for the background. Used the font-family property in the body selector to change the font to Orbitron and Ubuntu. Used the header element selector to set the background-color property. Used the color property to change the text and other content color. Used the padding property to change the spacing of the children content from the edges of the header. Used margin-top, margin-right, and margin-left properties to remove any whitespace between the header and the top and side edges of the window. Used the position property with the value sticky in order to make the header stay in its position when scrolling on the page. Used the top position to define where the header should start from at the top. Used the box-shadow property to apply a shadow so that the header seems like it is floating above the rest of the content on the page. Used the font-size, font-weight, color, and text-align properties to style the text in the header using an id selector. Used the border property to add a rectangular border to the name in the header. Used the display property to change the block type of the heading element to inline. Used the width property and height property to style the size of the image element.

- **Add a simple JavaScript Animation to the page**: Applied a gradual fade in function in JavaScript for the image displayed on the page that gradually increases the opacity of the image using the setInterval method in order to make the image have a fade in animation when the page is initially loaded.

- **Experiment with other semantic HTML tags**: Utilized the header, footer, main, img, anchor, div, and h1-h4 tags.

### Design Achievements

- **Used the Orbitron and Ubuntu Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used a combination of Orbitron and Ubuntu fonts as the fonts for the primary copy text in my site.
