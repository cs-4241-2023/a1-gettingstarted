## Technical Achievements
- **Added rules for the p, li, h1, h2, ul, img, body, and a selectors. For the Image I added a CSS animation.
I also added a navbar and linked the items to the homepage of google. For the body I added a gradient background to the website. I italicized my name and styled it as crimson**

### Design Achievements
- **I used Black Ops One as the font for the primary copy text in my site. I also used a color pallette from https://coolors.co/ to get the background gradient and font colors**
