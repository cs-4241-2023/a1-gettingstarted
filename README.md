Technical Achievements
Styled page with CSS: 1. This page is styled using color, font size, text align, border, background color, and font family.
The animation shows a square moving from left to right when the button is clicked, and then when clicked again it resets the square and restarts the animation.
The semantic HTML tags that I used were a footer, as well as a few embedded links within the paragraphs. These links included pulling you to my linkedin profile when clicking my name, showing you where I'm from, and a link to the WPI website.
Design Achievements
I used 5 colors from the color pallete shown in the image I have linked.
I used the roboto font from Google Fonts.
