experience with programming languages. This page demonstrates my use of various HTML tags, an internal style sheet in CSS,
and the technical and design achievements listed below.

<h2> Technical Achievements: </h2>
- Styled page with CSS: Added color rules for the p, li, h1, h2, and body. Added font size and font family rules for body.
- Used <b></b> tags to bold the "CS Classes I took at WPI," "Experience with Programming Languages," and "Work Experience"

<h2> Design Achievements: </h2>
