## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Rules added for h1, h2, p, ul, iframe, and footer selectors. I also took advantage of custom classes and utilized element IDs to give specific rules for specific elements.

- **Simple Animation**: Made a simple color cycling animation using CSS and it gets triggered by JavaScript. 

- **Other Tags Used/Semantic Tags Used**: 
  - 2 Buttons
  - image
  - footer
  - header
  - iframe
  - links/anchor
  - I have a script tag if you consider that one of the semantic tags
### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.

- **Color Palette made with color.adobe.com and used throughout the site**: Screenshot is in the "assets" folder. All 5 Colors are used in the color change animation and all 5 of them are used statically as well
