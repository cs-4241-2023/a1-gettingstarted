Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

*DUE: Thursday, August 31st by 11:59 AM (before the start of class!)*  

First assignment! You will deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to [Glitch](http://www.glitch.com/). 

Treat this assignment as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Glitch, as well as experiment some with HTML/CSS/JS. If you already know these, great! 
However, if you're new to them, spend several hours practicing, experimenting, and reading documentation. Don't just get your website up and done, as
you'll need skills with these tools throughout the rest of the course.

For this assignment I added css styling for the h1, h2, p, body and table tags. I gave them colors based on a color palte from Adobe. I added a table, image, header and footer. The image of color palate is on the website.
