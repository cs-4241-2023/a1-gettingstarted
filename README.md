This project shows that I know how to download and clone a Git repository, create and edit code to style the appearance of an HTML page, and deploy that web page onto Glitch.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: added in rules for the h1, p, body, ul, li, footer, img, and button tags
- **Added JavaScript animation to the page**: I included a button on the bottom labeled "Cat Button" which changes the height and width of the cat image to a random number between 0 and 60% of it's original size.
- **Experimented with semantic HTML tags**: I used the footer, b, img, i, and button tags to enhance the quality of my HTML page
