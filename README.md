This project shows a webpage with some information about me including CS classes I've taken and experience with different coding languages. The page was made using HTML and stylized with CSS, using JavaScript to make the it more interactive.

Due to the styling I used, the page can look messier depending on the screen dimensions. I tested with different dimensions and with a smaller width the info boxes are cramped, but still readable by dragging or closing them.

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**
    - Added rules for body, a, button, and added classes
    - Set color, background color, starting positions for information boxes, margin, and padding as needed for different elements
    - For example, the box class has rules for color, border, background-color, margin, overflow, position, and width
    - The page is styled to look like multiple smaller windows opened on a desktop
- **Added animation and interaction to the page**
    - The boxes across the page can be dragged by the bar at the top and exited with "x" button - I used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp as a reference when I was having trouble with the drag function
    - The "HELLO" text is a button that resets the layout of the page
    - The "WORLD!" text is a button that starts a rain animation 
        - @keyframes used to make drops fall and water rise, changing the backdrop color of the page
- **Experiment with other semantic HTML tags**
    - Added links to different pages on wpi.edu, an image, and buttons (the "HELLO WORLD!" buttons and the buttons to close windows)
    - The div containing "HELLO WORLD!" is in the header

### Design Achievements
- **Created/used a color palette**
    - Created a color palette using color.adobe.com: #6F97AD, #EDF8FE, #BAE3FA, #AD8B5E, #FADEB9
- **Used the font from Google Fonts**
    - The Gaegu font from Google fonts was used for all text on the page
