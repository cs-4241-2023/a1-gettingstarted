## Option 2 - Fork repo and import to Glitch, edit on Glitch, and then export back to GitHub

Most of these steps are the same as option 1, except that you being by creating a new project Glitch using this repo as a staring point (just choose New Project > Import from GitHub for this and then paste in the link to your repo). At the end, you can export your Glitch project to GitHub by [following these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=77&v=aWJFbtrgW4E&feature=emb_logo). _Note that the location of the projecct export feature in Glitch has moved from what they show in this video._ It's now located in Tools > Import and Export (tools is located in the bottom left of the Glitch editor).

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the li, p, img, background, h1, h2, h3, and for the button for formatting. I used padding, edited the font-size, display, positioning, and margins.
- **Added a simple Javascript animation**: I created a "dark mode" function for my website, that uses a button to change the color of the background and text.
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: I used an image, link, and button tag. I also used ul-li to create bullet points.
### Design Achievements
- **Create a color pallete**: Here are the colors I used for my color pallete. A screenshot will also be available on my git repo: #FA91AE,#CA76DB,#B6A1F0,#869ED9,#CBF6FF
- **Used the Figtree Font and Noto Sans Display Font from Google Fonts**: I used Noto Sans for my name/title at the top of the website and I used Figtree for the rest of the text.
