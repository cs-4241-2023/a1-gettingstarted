This project shows a webpage with basic information about me, such as major and year, as well as previous experiences. It also has some additional design and technical touches to it, which are listed below.

## Technical Achievements
- **CSS Styling**
    - Style Rule 1: Body Background Color (body)

    - Description: Sets a light gray background color for the entire page, creating a pleasant and readable environment for the content.

    - Style Rule 2: Header Styling (h1)

    - Description: Styles the main heading to have a larger font size, centered alignment, and a dark gray color. The margin-top provides spacing from the top of the page.

    - Style Rule 3: Paragraph and List Styling (p, ul)

    - Description: The first selector applies styles to all paragraphs, setting a standard font size, line height, and a medium gray color. The margin-bottom adds space between paragraphs. The second selector styles unordered lists by giving them square bullets and applying left margin for better organization.

    - Style Rule 4: Experience Section Styling (h2, p:nth-of-type(2))

    - Description: The first selector styles subsection headings with a slightly smaller font size, a muted color, and some top margin. The second selector targets the second paragraph and makes its content bold, emphasizing the major and minor information.
    
    - Style Rule 5: List Item Styling (li)

    - Description: Styles list items with a smaller font size, a subdued color, and a slight bottom margin, ensuring visual consistency and readability.

- JavaScript Animation:
    - This embedded JavaScript code adds a simple animation to the page. It creates a blue square that starts at the left side of the screen and moves horizontally to the right until it reaches the right edge.
- Other HTML Tags:
    - Header: represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. It's used to define the header of a document or a section.

    - Navigation: used to define a container for navigation links. It typically contains a list of navigation items, such as links to different sections of the website. Currently it only contains dummy links.

    - Main Content: used to enclose the main content of the document. It represents the central content unique to the document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.

    - Article: defines a self-contained composition in a document. It's used for content that can stand alone and make sense on its own.

    - Footer: represents a footer for a document or a section. It typically contains information about the author, copyright information, or links to related documents.


### Design Achievements
- **Used Adobe Color Palette**: I incorporated all the colors from the color palette generated on Adobe's website, which can be seen in the screenshot colorPalette.png.
