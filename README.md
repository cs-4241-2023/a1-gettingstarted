This project shows a basic understanding of html, css, and java script. A basic page has been created to display various information.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, li, and footer. All tags had their color and background set according to the color pallete. In addition to this there were other rules added. The body's font was set to Josefin Sans and its margins were removed. The h1, h2, p, and footer tags all had their padding set to 8px. The h1 tag also had its margins removed. Finally, the footer's display was set to flex to allow for the simple JS animation. 
*(Summary: edited 6 tags total with 7 different attributes changed.)*
- **Added simple JS animation**: Added a simple java script animation that scrolls the copyright notice at the bottom of the page from left to right repeatedly.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a Color Palette**: Used color.adobe.com to pick a color palette and used it thoughout the page. The background is colored #B7F5D1, the h1 and h2 text are both colored #A4DBBB with a custom background of #28362E, the main text of the page is colored #28362E, list items are colored #587564, and the copyright notice in the footer is colored #88B59B.
- **Used the Josefin Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used Josefin Sans as the font for all of the text in my site.
- **Used additional HTML tags**: I used the footer tag to contain the copyright notice at the bottom of the page and the link tag to import both my own css file and a Google font.
