This project, written in HTML and CSS, describes a bit about my previous CS and work experience. It makes use of a compound color palette generated using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com).

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the header, body, h1, table, td, th, p, footer, and mark selectors, as well as for custom classes.
- **Explored other semantic HTML tags**: Based on the definition and examples of semantic elements given [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp), the header, footer, mark, time, table (and subsequently table header, table row, table cell, etc.) tags were included in this project.

## Design Achievements
- **Created Adobe Color palette**: A compound color palette, a screenshot of which can be seen in the palette_adobe.jpg file in this repo, was generated for and used in this project.
- **Used the Tourney and Marck Script Fonts from Google Fonts**: Tourney was used as the main font for the page, with Marck Script being used for the footer. (These fonts perhaps create readability issues and may need to be reworked later.)
