This project shows how I have explored and experimented with various elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the use of Git, GitHub, and Glitch. I have 
expanded upon the initial assignment to include addition information about myself such as my project experience, my campus involvements, and my contact information. 
To do so, I used all the technical and design achievements, described in detail below.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: I added the following CSS rules and more to various html elements:
  1. **padding**: to create space around an element's content within its borders 
  2. **background-color**: to set the color of the background of an element 
  3. **font-size**: to set the font size 
  4. **vertical-align**: to set the vertical alignment of an element
  5. **border-style**: to set the border style of an element; need this for border to appear so that other border CSS rules can be applied
- **Added simple JavaScript animation**: For my JavaScript animation, my h1 element rotates through various colors from my color palette.

- **Other HTML tags used**: I used the following tags (and more): header, main, footer, table, article, summary/details.
  1. **Header**: The header tag includes the introductory information of the web page. These are the h1, my headshot image, my general introduction paragraph, and my 
  major information.
  2. **Main**: Following the header, the main tag includes the main information of the web page. This includes the experience and campus involvements sections.
  3. **Footer**: Following the main, the footer tag includes the contact information of the web page.
  4. **Table**: All information about my working experience can be found in a table tag. The table header includes company, position, location, date range, and 
  description. Each entry follows below in their corresponding rows.
  5. **Article**: All information about my project information can be found in various article tags. Most titles include links to further project details and each 
  article has a header (h4) and a paragraph.
  6. **Summary / Details**: All information about my clubs and activities can be found in details and summary tags. The summary tag holds the title of the club and the 
  details includes club position and a short description in paragraphs.

### Design Achievements

- **Created a color palette using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).**: I created a color palette using coolors.co and implemented the appropriate CSS throughout the 
web page. They can be seen in h1, h2, h3, and h4. They can also be seen in the background, in various borders, and in the table hover feature. 

  The color palette values can be found here: #344e41, #3a5a40, #588157, #a3b18a, #dad7cd. The actual colors can be found in the CoolorPalette.png.

- **Used the DM Serif Display & DM Sans Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**: I used [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans?query=DM+Sans) 
as the font for all paragraph, table, and list text on my site and [DM Serif Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display?query=DM+Serif+Display) for all 
headers (h1, h2, h3, & h4).
