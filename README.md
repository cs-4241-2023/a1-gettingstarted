This project shows uses a webpage featuring basic HTML and CSS to display some basic information about myself.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Changed the font of the body of the page, changed the background color of the header, made the header into a flexbox and used the
justify-content and align-items rules, changed the text color of the h1, h2, and h3 elements, added a border to
the table element, and added various other rules.

- **Experimented with semantic HTML tags**: Added a header, footer, table, main, image, and link element to the webpage.

### Design Achievements
- **Created and used a color palette using color.adobe.com**:
Created and used a monochromatic color palette using color.adobe.com and WPI's primary red color (#A6192E in hex). These colors are
featured in the header background, header texts, table header texts, and table header border.
- **Used the Merriweather font from Google Fonts**: I used Merriweather as the font for all the text on my site.
