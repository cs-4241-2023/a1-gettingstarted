## Technical Achievements

### Tailwind CSS

- **Why Tailwind?**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that promotes rapid UI development. It provides a set of utility classes that can be applied directly in the HTML, making it easier to build responsive and maintainable designs without writing custom CSS.
- **Tailwind Config**: The project setup would have allowed for customization of Tailwind's configuration. However, I considered this out of scope for this assignment and opted for direct CSS imports for custom colors.

### JavaScript Animation

- **Progress Bars**: The website features animated progress bars that indicate my proficiency in various technologies. These bars are implemented using JavaScript. Upon page load, each bar starts at zero and dynamically fills up to its designated percentage, providing a visually engaging way to display skill levels.

### Semantic HTML Tags

- **Footer**: The `footer` HTML tag is used to create a footer section at the bottom of the webpage. This footer contains a copyright notice and a direct link to my portfolio website, serving as a formal closure to the webpage content.

## Design Achievements

### Custom Color Palette

- A custom color palette was chosen to give the website a unique and cohesive look. These colors were directly imported using CSS to maintain the design consistency across the website.

### Google Fonts

- **Roboto**: The Roboto font was imported from Google Fonts and applied site-wide. This font was chosen for its readability and modern aesthetic, which aligns well with the overall design philosophy of the website.
