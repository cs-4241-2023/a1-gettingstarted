## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added a general rule to the whole website that applies a background color from my color palette and changes the font to the google font Shantell Sans.
I also added ruled for h1, h2, p, li, table, th, td changing the color of the text of these elements. 
I edited the table, th, td tags to add a circular border around the table and each element in the tables.
I edited the default html button to change the background of the button to match the overall website, and created an id that makes the position of the button absolute so I can later adjust the left align for my javascript animation.
- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: Within the script.js folder I built a function that moves the button with the id movingButton away from the mouse whenever clicked so it appears to make the button unclickable. The button's css and id is also contained within the styles.css folder.
- **Experiment with other semantic HTML tags**: The semantic html tags I used in order of appearance in index.html are the <image> tag to show my photo on my page, the <a> tag to link to the WPI website in my description, the <table> along with the <tr> and <th> tags to display the table of my experience with the various technologies and methods, the <footer> tag to display the text at the bottom of the page that acts as a last edited time of feature, and the <time> tag which is in the footer and contains the date and time I last edited the page.


### Design Achievements
- **Create a color palette using color.adobe.com.**: I found a color palette on adobe color and linked it below, if the link does not work the colors are #91BBF2, #035AA6, #023059, #011526, #0367A6.
  The title text of the page uses the color #011526, the description under my image uses the color #035aa6, the experience and fun stuff title uses the color #023059, the background of the whole website uses the #91BBF2 color, and the button uses the #0367a6 color for the text Click Me!, but otherwise uses the same background color as the whole website.

- **I used the Shantell Sans google font**: This font is used for the whole website and all its text, it is located in the * tag in styles.css
