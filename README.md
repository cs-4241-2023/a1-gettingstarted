This project shows a card displaying a basic description of who I am. The card, when hovered, will rotate horizontally to show more information about myself on the back of it. 
## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added multiple classes/id's to stylize multiple elements of my page. In addition, I played around with CSS animations by making the card able to flip on hover.
    Classes: card, card-front, card-inner, card-front, card-back
    IDs: experiences
    Elements: *, h1, img, ul
- **Dynamically add List Elements**: I wanted to experiment with adding items to the DOM using Javascript only. Thinking about it again, I can also remove the ul tag and instead create that through Javascript. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Lora Font from Google Fonts**: I used Lora as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Created and used a Material UI Color Palette**: I chose a color scheme using Google's Material Design (https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors).
