# Technical Achievements
**Created basic JavaScript button animation**:
I added ID's to the elements, and created a button that when clicked calls a hideShow()
function in my external JS file "script.js". This function tests to see if elements are
currently visible, and if they are it makes all the information on the page invisible and
changes the name of the button from "Hide Info" to "Show Info". Now when clicked again, it
makes all the buttons visible again, and changes the button name back to "Hide Info".

**Styled page with CSS**:
Added rules for body, h1, h2, p, button, and ul.

# Design Achievments
**Used the Nunito Font from Google Fonts**:
I used Nunito as the primary font for all text on my page.
