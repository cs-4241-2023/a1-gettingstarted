(max 5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README.
In my css file I used width and height to adjust the sizing of my photo on the page. I also used the font-style rule and the font-family rule to make certain text italicized and a different font. Furthermore, to make my table look better on the eyes I added padding to the indexes of the table and added a border to the table.

(max 5 points) Experiment with other semantic HTML tags (links, images, tables, header, footer, etc.) Each extra tag you use will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the tags you use in your README.
In my HTML file I used a header, footer, table, an image, as well as a link (located in the footer). The table, header, and footer are simply a joke, the image is of myself, and the link is the the wpi.edu website.

Design Achievements

(5 points) Use a font from Google Fonts in your website.
Right under the linking of my css file in my html file (in the head section) I linked a reference to the google font Trirong. From there, I utilized this implemented font in my css file, calling all h1 sections to use this font.
