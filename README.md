Nathan Wong

https://a1-nathanwong.glitch.me/

This project shows a webpage that acts as a protfolio for myself. On this webpage, you can find my technical skills and projects that I have worked on in GitHub.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
1. Centered h1 text with 'Nathan Wong' text at the top of page (lines 8-10 in style.css)
2. Changed background color of body section which allows the entire page background to be color `#e1dad2` (line 4 in style.css)
3. Changed font color of all p and li tags to `#d37556` (lines 16-18 in style.css)
4. Changed the font weight of spans to bold to highlight the beginning of p sections (lines 20-23 in style.css & lines 16, 20, 23, 26, 40 in index.html)
5. Reduced the margin-top to -10px between ul tags and their corresponding p tags to show greater connection between the two tags (lines 25-27 in style.css) so that the list header is closer to the list itself

- **Added other semantic tags**:
1. Added the footer tag to the bottom of the webpage for external links (lines 47-49 in index.html)
2. Added an `<a>` tag to redirect to my GitHub page (line 48 in index.html)

## Design Achievements
- **Created a color page for the website**: Used a color palette from [Jordan Prindle Designs](https://www.jordanprindledesigns.com/blog/color-palettes) that includes five colors. All colors were used with h1 tags being `#0c2431`, the h2 tags being `#194a50`, the body background color being `#e1dad2`, the list elements being `#d37556`, and the additional info of list items being `#d8a28c`.
- **Used the Ubuntu Font from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu Regular as the font for all body text in my site.
