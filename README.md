This project shows a brief introduction of myself and my experience in CS and IMGD. I included my majors, graduation year, hobbies, and experience for content. On the technical side, I used a variety of semantic tags to experiment with what they did including nav, tables, aside, and different semantic text tags. I also added a type writer animation for one of the quotes I have on the site.

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for
    - aside: made it look like a sidenote by changing background color and font style to italics
    - body: set a max width for the body to make it look more vertical
    - td: set the text to vertically align at the top of each table cell as it defaults to centering in the middle of the cell
    - ul.centered_list: makes the list elements centered (without this the bullet points will be in the wrong position)
    - #media_embed, #innerdiv, #outerdiv: all works together to fit the iframe that holds the youtube embeds and images inside a table cell
- **Semantic HTML tags**: Added tags for
    - iframe: for youtube video embeds
    - table, tr, td: table elements to structure layout for the experience section... (after doing this, I realized that this might not be the most ideal way for structuring the layout for this since it doesn't handle screen size responsiveness well)
    - nav: used this to hold a number of links to my personal websites
    - image: added a few images here and there
    - blockquote: I included a quote for myself
    - aside: houses the quote and looks like a sidenote of some sort
- **Javascript Animation**
    - I made a type writer animation for my quote. It was challenging for me to get situated with the language as I am not too familiar with it. Here is a guide I followed to make this animation. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp
