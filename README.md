This project showcases a bit of who I am, my experience with several technologies, and the past computer science courses I have taken. 

## Technical Achievements
- Styled page with CSS:
   - Added rules for h1 and h2 to have padding
   - Set the website background color and text color in the body rule
   - I have created a .color-text rule to use inside of the HTML to color specific bits of text differently. I would insert a span around the text I want to color inside HTML and then add the color-text class to apply the styling.
   - I have created DIVs to create boxes around my text and created .container and .container-boxy rules to apply color, align the text to the center for the regular container box for the header of the website, added margins, box-shadow, and added a dynamic width to the containers so that they take up 90% of the width of the screen until the width reaches 900px then it stops expanding.
   - Then I also added padding for p, p2, and ul rules to make that text also fit nicely in the containers.

### Design Achievements
- Used Nunito Sans Font From Google Fonts: I used the Nunito Sans Font for all of the text on my website.
- I have created a color palette using color.adobe.com, "ColorWheel.png" in my repo, and used all of the colors in the palette:
   - Color A: I have used this color as the main background-color for my website
   - Color B: I have used this color as the background-color for all of the containers containing text information on the website.
   - Color C: I have used this color as the box-shadow for all of the containers mentioned above on the site.
   - Color D: I have used this color as the text color on all of the text on the website
   - Color E: I have used this color as a highlight text color to separate out information like the Class of 2024 text from the title, course numbers from course names, and technology from experience.
