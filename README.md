## Technical Achievements

-**Used Inline CSS to apply colors and formatting to Headers and paragraphs.** Within this HTML file, there are a lot of similar CSS stlyes applied to the text on the page. For simplicity, we will focus on the 5 different styles present within the page. Initially, the name, major, and class all follow the same conventions for styling. They all use text align: center, background color: white, and border: 2px solid black. I chose to go with these options as they are simple and allow the most important parts of the page to stand out. This was somewhat trivial as the inline css was repeated, however it was good practice to see what I can do with the inline style attribute. Next, we have the paragraph of previous classes. The paragraph also uses a simple inline css style. The paragraph is simply centered within the page to increase readability and attractiveness. The body also uses a simple css rule that sets the background color to gray to add to the contrast of other css rules. Finally, the levels of experience are similar with their css attributes, as are the subsequent skills and languages. A Lot of experience makes use of center, underline, and blue color. Similarly, some experience makes use of center, underline, and the orange color. Little/no also follows the same convetions with the red color. The languages and skills listed below each category also make use of CSS. They are related to the headers of their category with the only difference among the three levels of experience being the underline attribute is not included in the containing lists. These colors and attributes were chosen to increase readability, relatability, and the overall appeal of the page.  
-**Created 7 functions for the 7 simple animations that take place 7 seconds after the page has loaded.** For a simple javascript animation, initally there is no CSS applied to the page. Using the id attribute present within name, class, major, classes, aLot, some, and little; the page has a timeout function that is set to showcase the previously mentioned css every second after the page is loaded. There are seven functions to represent the seven individual transitions that happen on the page. The page initially has no css applied to it and the longer that the page is looked at,(up to seven seconds) the more detail is added to the page. This was somewhat challenging at first to get the correct attributes and apply the correct css to the respective paragraphs and headers, but using the timeout function in the script allows for the webpage to seem as though it is formating itself. -**Uploaded an image to assets within Glitch and used the internal image path to display an image of myself.** Within the webpage, there is an image present using the img tag. This was somewhat challenging at first to find the correct path to reference the image and make it appear. The image was uploaded to the assets within glitch, which was used to find the proper path and reference the image. The image portrays a better understanding of myself to the reader and gives me some experience with internally linked images.

### Design Achievements

- **Used the Phudu Font from Google Fonts**: I used the Phudu font from google to make my webpage more appealing to a reader. This was accomplished by linking the font to an internal style sheet to be present throughout the webpage. This was a little finicky to implement becasue of the linking to google, but the resulting design benefits from the fancier font.
