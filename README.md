===

*DUE: Thursday, August 31st by 11:59 AM (before the start of class!)*  

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. 
You will simply deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to [Glitch](http://www.glitch.com/). 

*Technical*
1. (max 5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README.
2. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
3. (max 5 points) Experiment with other HTML tags (links, images, tables etc.) Each extra tag you use will get you 1 extra point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the links you use in your README.

*Design*
1. (10 points) Create a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Use all the colors in the palette in your webpage by implementing the appropriate CSS. Add a small screenshot of the color wheel for your color palette to your repo.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body for Google font and coloring, adjusted my header css to make it bold and larger. I added a few dividers with their own styling per each. Having different sizes and making them centered. I also have a styling for a button for my javascript animation as well as CSS for my animation. I also added CSS for my profile picture and how the color of my LinkedLn link appears. 

- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: Added a little box that would move when a button is pressed. I referenced https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_animate.asp for the animation box. As a heads up when ported to glitch the box may not be seen if the preview isn't big enough. I wrote this all in VSCode and looked at firefox when 
implementing it.

- **Added extra tags**: I added a link on the bottom of a page to my LinkedLn, one to my github page, and a link to WPI since I didn't have any other portfolios. I added a Image tag as a profile picture. There's a button on the bottom of my page to initiate the Javascript as mentioned above.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Open Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used Open Sans font from Google for my primary font.

-**Color Palette:** I used a color pallet from pigment.shapefactory.co. The two colors being Christalle (#421073) and Tradewind (#5CB5B2). Here is the link to that color palette generation. https://pigment.shapefactory.co/?a=421073&b=5CB5B2 I also will include an image in the repository.
