This project shows an HTML webpage that includes some information about myself as well as the class I am taking, and images and testing various semantic HTML tags.

Technical Achievements
* Styled page with CSS: Added 
Rules like color, font-family, margin-top, font-size, text-align, background-color, height, width, padding, float, box-shadow and font-style for h1, p, p1, li, a, header, footer, aside selectors.
Added a basic JavaScript animation where a square of 150px is made to change between the colors of the color palette chosen using keyframes.
Other semantic HTML tags that I used are header, footer, aside, images and links.

Design Achievements

* I created color palette using color.adobe.com. 
* The colors I chose were #BA4AFE, #4379E6, #56FCCA, #81E643, #FFE365 by adding them to the CSS. I also added the image of the color wheel to the webpage itself too.

* Used the Black Ops One Font from Google Fonts: I used Black Ops One for the personal information text part in my site.
