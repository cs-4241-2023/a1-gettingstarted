## Technical Achievements
- Use background-color to set page background to light blue and each section to a slightly darker blue
- Hovering over a section darkens it a little, to hint at clicking to toggle collapse
- Add margin and padding to give some space for sections, and round corners to look more smooth
- all the sections start collapsed, except the first one
- Slight padding to table rows, and set text align to left
- Javascript animation to toggle collapsing sections so that only one section shows at a time
- Use the following semantic tags for better readability: header, section, table, ul, footer. Also, used a hyperlink to my github page

### Design Achievements
- Used Adobe's monochromatic palette with a blueish hue
- Used the Ubuntu Font from Google Fonts, with a fallback font of sans-serif
