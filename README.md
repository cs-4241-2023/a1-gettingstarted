## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added style rules to the body, p, h2, h3, li, and ul selectors. This encompassed display and color adjustments, margin modifications, padding additions, and defining alignment attributes for these tags. 
- **JavaScript Animaiton**: Added a fade-in JavaScript animation for the content shown on my website and a JavaScript progress bar loading animation for each of the different programming skills. Animations run each time the website is loaded. 
- **Additional HTML Tags**: Used footer, img, u, div, a, and b tags. By utilizing these tags, I elevated the visual appeal of my website. These tags collectively contributed to a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing user experience by enhancing layout structure, incorporating images seamlessly, emphasizing key points, enabling effortless navigation, and highlighting important content.

### Design Achievements
- **Color Palette**: Created a color palette design scheme using Adobe Color and incorporated it into my website. An image showcasing the different colors is in the repo.
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used the Roboto font for the header and self-introduction part of my website, and used the Times New Roman font for the list items.
